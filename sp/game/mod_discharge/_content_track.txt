UPDATE:
Just put EVERY sound/model/texture you use in this list, RaraFolf will sort all of it out before release.
Please include the VMF file, it helps RaraFolf do that.
No need to list textures used by the model, RaraFolf will sort that out.

Do it like this:
ExampleName:
-sdk_examplemap1:
-- models/player/t_leet
-- materials/overlays/cake_picture
-- sound/misc/dod_nemesis
-sdk_examplemap2
-- models/agrunt
-- sound/fvox/boop

!!PREFIX ALL OF YOUR SP MAPS WITH "discharge_" AND MP MAPS WITH "dmcharge_" !!
sparrowstar:
-discharge_bootcamp
-- 

RaraFolf:
-dmcharge_office
--
